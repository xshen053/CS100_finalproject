## Project Description
* Designing and developing a task scheduler is interesting to us because most of us use some task scheduler software nowadays, such as Microsoft Todo. Therefore, we are curious about the mechanism of how to create a task scheduler. Whatâ€™s more, the function of the present task scheduler is limited. So if we want to add some new function or features, we can only do them ourselves. Realizing such a task scheduler can not only help us solidify what we learned in CS100, but can also help us improve our ability of time management.
  
 
* The languages/tools/technologies we used.
    * [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/) - Using this middle level language, we will create a console interface in which the client has the ability to input commands from the keyboard to utilize the system while also displaying the inputs on screen.
    
    * [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - We will use VScode to edit files like Readme.
    
    * [Visual Studio](https://cmake.org/) - We will use Visual Studio as an ide to develop the software.
    
    * [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - We will use Git as the version control tool to coordinate work, keep track of changes in our code, and keep our project up to date. 
    
    * [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) - We will use the Valgrind framework to construct dynamic analysis tools to help us with memory debugging and detecting memory leaks.



 * The input of our project would be task names, task descriptions, category labels, dates and times. Task names and descriptions will be anything the user enters, and user can also add category labels.
 * The output of our project would  be a list ordered by date and priority displayed for the user to review.




## Diagram description

By far, we use composite pattern to implement our task. This is implemented in the construction of the Project and the Tasks class being subclasses to the Abstract Class Component. 
   


 We use Composite pattern and strategy pattern.

 We use composite design pattern to help us implement hierarchy structure of our task scheduler.
We have a base class which is an abstract class, a Task class(leaf) and a SubList(Composite class). With the SubList class, we are able to create a hierarchy of subtasks and sub-lists. Besides, the Task class(leaf) covers a task that does not have other tasks embedded in it. The SubList class has an aggregation relationship with the tasks class because it has a vector of Tasks objects and it can also have vector of sub-lists. By using the composite pattern, user can interact with interfaces in an easier way.

We will also use the strategy pattern to enable program choose different classes(strategy) to use at runtime which is based on user choices. User can decide to display tasks the way they wants. The feature we will implement with this design pattern is printing out the user's tasks in different ways. The order can be chosen by the user, for example, they can choose to see their tasked printed by due date order, priority order, type of task order and they can choose to print both finished tasks and unfinished tasks. 


 With composite pattern, we do not need to worry about hierarchy of our class, we just need to consider task class as leaf and consider sublists classes as composite.
 
 With strategy pattern, it is possible for us to simplify our code to display the user's tasks in different orders.

# Example picture and description
## This is our project!
This menu will lead the user to interact with our project.

And then put in some example sublist, task, duedate.etc.

Now we tested creat sublist and task, and when you add task or sublist in a sublist, you will need to use the edit function.

But we will check view first, first it's view task/sublist by priority. High > meduim > low. And it only Compare main Sublist/task with each other.

Then we view task by duedates. It for main sublist too, and the due

Last we want to see personal task, so use j1 and only view personal task/sublist

![avatar](https://github.com/cs100/final-project-xshen053-hyu146-jfern025-vvino005/blob/master/picture/j1personal.png)

We can see study and work tasks/sublist is gone.

Now we check edit. OH NO, User typed the wrong task's name. It will return menu.

And this is our edit menu, and we are going to change finish states for sublist.

 and display this, we can see Sublist CS100 is the only "finished" sublist. But you didn't finish all the task inside Sublist, the project will show other that you are lying, you doesn't finish all CS100's task. So the task inside the CS100 Sublist will still be "unfinished"
 
 
 Then after edit another "finished". We check list all unfinished by duedate.

That's all the function, action you can have with our project. And there is a delete. which can delete all the task/sublist. everything will dispear like " rm -fr"

# Installation/Usage
Instructions on installing and running our application:
 In order to use our program, you would first clone our project repository (git clone https://github.com/cs100/final-project-xshen053-hyu146-jfern025-vvino005.git) into your local machine and change into its directory.
Next you would compile the application by running the command "g++ main.cpp -o main" in your terminal followed by "./main.exe" to execute it.

# Testing
We tested our project utilizing gtest for c++. We created a task folder that holds all of the seperate unit tests for each class and tested expected user inputs and invalid user inputs. The have a seperate branch to test the strategy pattern and we made mock test files to make sure that we implemented the functions correctly. We also tested mock main.cpp cases manually where we call the menu in a main.cpp, tests its actions and its functionality, and finally carry out those functions that implement both the composite pattern and strategy pattern.
